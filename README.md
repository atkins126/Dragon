PROGRAMMING
-----------
The game uses as a base a modified version of the DelphiDoom engine (version 1.1.3.489 beta - opengl mode). 

Some of the new enhancements of the original engine are: 

-Terrain with seamless integration with buildings!

-Simple shadows. 

-Sloped surfaces (eg the building's roofs, sloped floors).

-Pushable objects and walls.
